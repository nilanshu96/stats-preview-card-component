## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt working with css grid and flexbox. Most importantly I've learnt what is flex-basis (although it isn't in the solution) and using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows correctly. Also background images can overflow from a container and it's necessary to do a overflow:hidden to show the border-radius.

### Continued development

I'll be working to master flex and grid layout as I still am taking a lot of time to come with solutions

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25066214/flexbox-not-giving-equal-width-to-elements) - This helped me understand the correct meaning of flex basis
